## Overview

The study was conducted to test hypotheses regarding Starbucks customer factors, particularly the relationship between spending and visitation frequency across different age groups. The data used in this study is secondary data collected from [Starbucks Data]([http://www.starbucks.data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahirahmzh/starbucks-customer-retention-malaysia-survey)), including information from 122 customers.

## Objectives

1. Examine the difference in Starbucks price rates between regular and non-regular customers.
2. Plot the relationship between spending and visitation frequency across different age groups of customers.

## Methodology

- **Data Source:** The study is based on secondary data from the [Starbucks Data]([http://www.starbucks.data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahirahmzh/starbucks-customer-retention-malaysia-survey)) website, containing information from 122 customers.
- **Analysis:** Hypothesis testing was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test to check data normality. Given non-normal data distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to further analyze the data.
- **Data Visualization:** The study uses grammar of graphics to visualize the relationship between age groups, spending, and visitation frequency.

## Analysis and Interpretation

- **Hypothesis Testing:** The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant difference in Starbucks price rates between regular and non-regular customers.
- **Data Visualization:** The study shows that customers above the age of 30 spend more and visit Starbucks more frequently than younger customers. People under the age of 30 who rarely visit Starbucks spend little to no money.

## Conclusion

1. Customer ratings of Starbucks prices depend on whether the customer is a regular or non-regular visitor.
2. Visualization of spending patterns and visitation frequency can help Starbucks management tailor strategies for different age groups.

## Limitations

1. The dataset contains only 122 customers, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
2. Study questions do not cover the entire dataset.
3. Data collection methods and potential inconsistencies may affect the accuracy of results.
